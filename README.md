Use an API to return a random quote and if the request fails,
use the file recentquotes.json to show a random quote.


## how to use
```
1. clone repo to local machine
2. cd into directory
3. TO TEST: run ./gradlew test
4. TO RUN: run ./gradlew run

It will show you a random text and author after run.
```
